Osint for Crypto in this repository is to support the youtube video  that i shared
this is the link : <b> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frMFG4OrG2E </b>

including the script that i use in this video

In the video i will try to help to how to use the Spiderfoot and also use the script of python that i use in video

you just need python 3 and these library web3, requestss and sys
to get that library you just need to install it by thse command below

pip3 install web3    --> just test the script first, because ussually library 'requests' exist in common python 

then you can continue with <br>

pip3 install requests
